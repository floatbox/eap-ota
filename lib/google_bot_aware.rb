# This Rack middleware helps solving the issue with some Rails versions which do not accept
# a '*/*;q=0.6' and their variants 'Accept' request header. This header is particularly used
# by Google Bot, and if Rails doesn't like it, it will return a 500 or 406 error to Google Bot,
# which is not the best way to get your pages indexed.
